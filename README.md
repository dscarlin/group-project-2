# Reconnect

## Overview
This is an application to help people take advantage of free time to connect on the phone.
Text communication is a convenient method of staying in contact, but does not fully replace the value of committed back and forth real-time communication like having a verbal conversation.

### Uses
- Create an Account
  - Add image to your profile
  - Manage getting text push notifications if on ios system
- Create groups
  - Use real-time search to add members from the app's database
  - Remove members from group
- Set your status as available to talk
  - Set the status for specific group(s) or all groups
  - Set the time you are available to talk until (up to six hours from current time)
- View your groups, and how many members are available to talk in each group
  - View status of each member in the group
  - Call available members at the touch of a button
- Real- time updates
  - Any time a member changes their status, the server will check if you are connected with them and update your page accordingly
  - If you are set to available in any given group, you will receive a push notification when anyone else in that group becomes available to talk that includes their name, phone number, and time that they are available until
